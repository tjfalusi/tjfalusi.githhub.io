        <h1>Technology in Secondary</h1>
        <h3>Bloxels </h3>
        <p>Year Seven and Eight students  have been designing, building and testing video games using Bloxels  Builder.  Working collaboratively in small  groups their challenge was to create a game around a theme of their choice, ensuring  that all components of the game related back to the chosen game concept.  The students created, which they animated and  ensured that the game levels became increasingly difficult for the player.  Making decisions as a team was very important  and an area in which some students excelled and others found challenging.</p>
        <p><br>
          Some groups extended their  experience further by accessing the coding component to alter the default  settings in the App.  This allowed  further customisation of the gameplay to enhance their player&rsquo;s experience and  enjoyment. Many students chose to work on this activity at home to build their  own individual game which was above and beyond the expectations set.  </p>
        <p><br>
          The Bloxels team have released  the free app for Android and Kindle and are currently working on a PC &amp; Mac  desktop version to complement the Apple iOS program that we used at  Emmaus.  </p>
        <h3>ICA10111- Certificate I in Information, Digital Media and Technology</h3>
        <p> The ICT elective for Semester 1 is a Vocational Education and Training (VET) course for Years Nine and Ten.  The students must meet industry standards to achieve competencies in order to obtain their certificate. </p>
        <p> Skills are taught in basic computer operations, Word processing, Presentation software, Spreadsheet application, internet safety, and appropriate communicate expectations within a workplace scenario. </p>
<p> Students are appointed as office manager’s for a fictitious company and complete workplace requests, submitting their completed task as evidence of their ability to meet the standards outlined by the Department of Training.</p>
        <p>This is the first year this course has been taught at Emmaus and the students are working diligently to meet their requirements. </p>
